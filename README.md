# pics2html

The static site generator for pictures I wish I didn't have to write. If you
don't care about exif, this most certainly pointless for you.

## Why this?

I need to write a blog post to explain it and then I'll link it here

## Usage

0. Install dependencies: `pip install Pillow jinja2 rfeed`.
1. Put all pictures in output/pictures/. The name must be yyyy-mm-dd-title.jpg. Failure to abide will surely make the parser unhappy. And you don't want to make it unhappy. If you can avoid to use SMALL_IMAGE_WORD (as defined in the python script) in the title, it's probably better. Better as in otherwise it may not do what you thought. But the good news is you "can" use dashes instead of spaces in the title! ðŸ˜¬
2. Edit global var at the top of pics2html.py.
3. Run `python3 pics2tohtml.py` and let the magic happen.
4. It will create smaller pictures if they're bigger than the threshold, so it may
take some time the first time.
5. It will output all the html files so you just have to ship the whole dir.
